## 👋 Hey, I'm Jaideep Sharma@k1rm4d4.

I'm a backend engineer focused on building robust, scalable systems — with a deep focus on Python (FastAPI, Flask), distributed systems, and event-driven architecture.

---

## 🚀 Current Focus

- 🔧 Designing microservices using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and AWS (S3, EC2).
- 🔄 Event-driven systems, background task queues, async workers.
- 🔍 Preparing for backend/system design interviews — digging deep into DSA, low-level design, and Kubernetes.
- 🧱 Architecting a capstone project simulating a real-world digital product platform (inspired by Gumroad/Stripe).
